Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Create /suivi/[reference] public tracking page + API + scan context detection + WhatsApp pre-filled message generator

Work Log:
- Cloned qrbags repo from GitHub to restore previous session's work
- Updated Prisma schema: added `context`, `finderName`, `finderPhone` fields to ScanLog model
- Pushed schema with `bunx --bun prisma db push`
- Created `src/lib/scan-context.ts` with `detectScanContext()` — 4 contexts (departure/arrival/transit/static)
- Created `src/lib/whatsapp-message.ts` with `generatePreFilledMessage()` + `buildWhatsAppUrl()`
- Created `/api/suivi/[reference]/route.ts` — GET endpoint with rate limiting, data filtering (no email/owner phone/raw GPS)
- Updated `/api/scan/[reference]/route.ts` POST — saves context, finderName, finderPhone to ScanLog
- Created `/suivi/[reference]/page.tsx` — Full Design Billet Premium tracking page
- Updated `src/lib/logger.ts` — added 'suivi' to logMetric service type
- Added i18n keys (tracking.*) + finder context keys to FR/EN/AR locales

Self-Critique (3 bugs found & fixed):
1. `logMetric('suivi', ...)` — type error: 'suivi' not in union type → Fixed by adding 'suivi' to logger.ts
2. `ContextBadge` had dead `t === (() => '')()` comparison → Removed, used i18n key mapping instead
3. `fetchSuivi(showLoading)` logic inverted — initial load showed refresh spinner, manual refresh didn't → Fixed parameter semantics
4. Dead `lastScan` variable declared but unused in main render → Removed
5. `data.status === 'error'` not caught → Added to error guard
6. `isDeclaredLost` could be truthy with empty string → Added `!!` coercion
7. `window.open() ||` unused expression lint warning → Replaced with explicit null check
8. Unused imports `Luggage`, `User` → Removed

Stage Summary:
- 6 new files created, 3 existing files modified
- Zero TS errors, zero lint errors in all new/modified files
- Design 100% consistent with scan page (white bg, blue blocks, dashed borders, orange buttons)
- Security: API never exposes email, owner WhatsApp, raw GPS coordinates
- Google Maps iframe with lat/lon priority, address fallback, placeholder for unavailable
- i18n complete: FR, EN, AR with all tracking.* keys
- WhatsApp pre-filled message: 4 contextual scenarios, <400 chars, emoji formatting

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent (Self-Critique Round)
Task: Comprehensive audit and bug fix of /suivi feature

Work Log:
- Read and audited all 10 files: prisma schema, scan-context.ts, whatsapp-message.ts, suivi API route, suivi page, scan API route, logger.ts, fr/en/ar locales, scan page
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors (only pre-existing errors in admin/agence/success files)
- Ran `bun run lint` — zero errors
- Found BUG #1: Context dropdown missing from finder form (i18n keys existed but no <select> UI element)
- Found BUG #2: `selectedContext` missing from `handleWhatsApp` useCallback dependency array (stale closure)
- Found BUG #3: `selectedContext` missing from `handlePhoneCall` useCallback dependency array (stale closure)
- Found UX BUG #4: Found badge showed "VOTRE BAGAGE EST PROTÉGÉ" instead of "BAGAGE RETROUVÉ" — missing `badge_found` i18n key
- Fixed all 4 bugs

Stage Summary:
- Context dropdown now visible in finder form between WhatsApp input and Contact Buttons
- Both `handleWhatsApp` and `handlePhoneCall` now correctly send `context` in POST body
- `selectedContext` added to both dependency arrays (no stale closures)
- Added `tracking.badge_found` key to FR ("BAGAGE RETROUVÉ"), EN ("BAGGAGE FOUND"), AR ("تم العثور على الأمتعة")
- Badge logic now shows: lost → 🚨 badge_lost, found → ✅ badge_found, active → badge_active ✈️
- All pre-existing TS errors documented as out-of-scope (admin routes, agence layout, success page, etc.)

Task ID: 10
Agent: Main Agent (Self-Critique Audit)
Task: Comprehensive audit of all Phase 2 multi-transport feature files

Work Log:
- Read dev.log: server running on port 3000, no compilation errors
- Read worklog.md: all 9 priority tasks completed by sub-agents
- Verified all 16 files exist: schema, transport.ts, TransportModeSelector, inscrire, activate API, scan API+page, suivi API+page, 3 locale files, success, marketing, baggage detail
- Read full content of: prisma/schema.prisma, transport.ts, TransportModeSelector.tsx, inscrire/page.tsx, activate/route.ts, scan API+page, suivi API+page, all 3 locale files
- Grep-checked all transport-related code across scan/suivi pages (imports, conditional rendering, i18n keys)
- Grep-checked admin pages (marketing, baggage detail) for transport references
- Verified dashboard messages/*.json do NOT need transport keys (admin pages use hardcoded strings)
- Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` — all errors are pre-existing (admin/blog, agence/layout, api/admin, verify-email, auth, features, success canvas narrowing)
- Cross-referenced all i18n keys used in code with locale file contents

Bugs Found:
1. **BUG #1 (CRITICAL)**: Duplicate `transport` section in FR/EN/AR locale files (lines 109-133 and 216-258). Two sub-agents (Task 8 and Task 4-5) both added transport sections. JSON.parse keeps last-key-wins, so section 1 was dead code.
2. **BUG #2 (VISIBLE)**: `transport.select_mode_desc` key was ONLY in the first (losing) transport section. The inscrire page displayed raw key string "transport.select_mode_desc" instead of the translated text.
3. **BUG #3 (MINOR)**: Hardcoded French "Chargement..." in inscrire Suspense fallback.

Fixes Applied:
1. Removed first duplicate `transport` section (24 keys) from all 3 locale files
2. Added missing `select_mode_desc` key to the remaining single transport section in all 3 files
3. Replaced hardcoded "Chargement..." with "..." in Suspense fallback

Post-Fix Verification:
- All 3 JSON files validate successfully (node JSON.parse)
- `bun run lint` — 0 errors
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 new errors (all pre-existing)
- Grep confirms: exactly 1 `transport` section per locale file
- Grep confirms: `select_mode_desc` present in all 3 locales
- No hardcoded French transport strings in scan/suivi pages
- No transport keys missing that code references

Task ID: 11
Agent: Main Agent (Chatbot KB Enhancement)
Task: Transform existing chatbot into intelligent support agent with QRBag Knowledge Base

Work Log:
- Phase 1 Analysis: Discovered chatbot already fully implemented (API route 317 lines, Widget 291 lines, 15 i18n keys × 3 languages, feature flag, kill switches)
- Identified 8 gaps between existing implementation and spec (KB prompt missing, timeout too long, temp/tokens wrong, response field name, fallback message, no transportMode, no sanitization, logging)
- Phase 2 Code Generation in strict priority order:
  1. Rewrote `/api/scan/chat/route.ts` (317→280 lines):
     - Replaced generic 6-line system prompts with full KB prompts (FR/EN/AR) containing: service description, pages, tarifs, SAV, FAQ TOP 5, confidentiality rules, transport context
     - Added `sanitizeQuestion()` — strips HTML tags, code blocks, backticks
     - Added `withTimeout()` wrapper (Promise.race, 3s strict)
     - Changed Groq params: temperature 0.5→0.7, max_tokens 200→300
     - Added `transportMode` to baggageContext validation + DB enrichment with `safeTransportMode()` fallback
     - Changed response format: `content` → `answer`
     - Changed fallback messages: "contact owner via WhatsApp" → SAV contact (support@qrbags.com)
     - Added `console.log('[Groq/Chat] ${reference} → ${latencyMs}ms')` on success path
     - History messages now sanitized via `sanitizeQuestion()`
     - Added `satisfies ChatResponse` type annotation on all responses
  2. Modified `ChatbotWidget.tsx` (3 targeted edits):
     - Added `transportMode?: string` to baggageContext props type
     - Changed `data.content` → `data.answer` (matching API response)
     - Increased send button from w-10 h-10 (40px) → w-11 h-11 (44px) for accessibility
  3. Modified `scan/[reference]/page.tsx` (1 line):
     - Added `transportMode: baggage.transportMode || undefined` to ChatbotWidget baggageContext prop
  4. Modified `public/locales/{fr,en,ar}.json` (1 key each):
     - `chatbot.error_fallback` updated to SAV-oriented message (support@qrbags.com)

- Validation:
  - JSON: 3/3 locale files valid
  - ESLint: 0 errors
  - TypeScript: 0 new errors in modified files (pre-existing errors in admin/agence/features/auth unchanged)
